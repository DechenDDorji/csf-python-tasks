Updates the game state, including ball and paddle positions, and handles scoring (update_game_state method).
Provides methods to retrieve scores and paddle positions.

TestPongGame class:
Inherits from unittest.TestCase and contains test cases for the PongGame class.

test_ball_movement: Testing the movement of the ball in the game.
test_scoring: Testing the score logic when the ball goes out of bounds.
